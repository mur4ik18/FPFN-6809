* Idea of the project:
To build a virtual file system that permet to stock binaries in the
memory and access them by using an application, that can reads files
and modify them in the future.

** Memory mapping
#+begin_src dessein
  0xFFFF ---------
         |       |
         |ROM 16k|
         |       |
  0xC000 ---------
         |       |
         | EMPTY | For new devices
         |       |

#+end_src

In my disopsition I have only 0x0000-0x7C00 => 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (+ 
   (* 7  (expt 16 3)) 
   (* 12 (expt 16 2)) 
   (* 0  (expt 16 1)) 
   (* 0  (expt 16 0))
  )
  ; 31744
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 31744

So, I have only 31744 bytes for all, for files storage.  In ROM I will
have my application that will create file system and manage this.

** 6809 registers
- A accum (8Bits)
- B accum (8Bits)
- D accum (16Bits)
- X index (16Bits)
- Y index (16Bits)
- DP page register (8Bits)
- CC state (8Bits)
- U stack pointer user
- S stack pointer System


* Virtual file system
It should store in ram some modifiables files. So I need to know where
to find thats files.

| # | catalog name | start loc | size   |
|---+--------------+-----------+--------|
| 1 | 11 byte      | 2 byte    | 3 byte |
| . | ...          | ..        | ..     |
| 4 |              |           |        |
|---+--------------+-----------+--------|


16 bytes for each element of catalog.

Catalog position + #112 = last element of catalog.


* Files
Name of file shouldn't containe any spaces. Each file is txt, so you
don't need to add it. Moreower you are limited in length by 10 bytes
(10 characters).

Size of each file is limited by 4096 bytes. End of the file should be
indicated by three zeros.

#+begin_src
$00 $00 $00
#+end_src
