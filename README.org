* Idea of the project:
To build a virtual file system that permet to stock binaries in the
memory and access them by using an application, that can reads files
and modify them in the future.

** Memory mapping
#+begin_src dessein
  0xFFFF ---------
         |       |
         |ROM 16k|
         |       |
  0xC000 ---------
         |       |
         | EMPTY | For new devices

#+end_src

In my disopsition I have only 0x0000-0x7C00 => 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (+ 
   (* 7  (expt 16 3)) 
   (* 12 (expt 16 2)) 
   (* 0  (expt 16 1)) 
   (* 0  (expt 16 0))
  )
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 31744

So, I have only 31744 bytes for all, for application and files
storage.
